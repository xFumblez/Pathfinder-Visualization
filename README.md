# Pathfinder Visualization
 A C++ program made in Visual Studio Community 2019.
 Can run program using the .sln file. 
 
 The program opens in the terminal and randomly generates a map with a max size of 60x60 with randomly placed walls. 
 Uses DFS recursive traversal to draw a path from a random or given start point and end point. 
 Can also use BFS to find path but will not draw it.
 
 Can also generate a map with user defined sizes and start/end locations, but still randomly places walls.
